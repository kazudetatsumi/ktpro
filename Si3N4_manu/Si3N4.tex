\begin{abstract}
The lattice thermal conductivities of $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and
$\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$ phases are investigated from {\it ab-initio}
anharmonic lattice dynamics, within the single-mode relaxation-time
approximation of the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. At
300 K, the lattice thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ is
calculated as $\kappa_{xx}=73$ and $\kappa_{zz}=199$ (in units of W
m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$), which is consistent with the reported experimental
values of 69 and 180, respectively. For $\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$,
$\kappa_{xx}=68$ and $\kappa_{zz}=100$ are obtained.  The difference in
anisotropy between these phases originates from the characteristic
differences in their phonon band structures, which is closely related to
the crystal structures.  In $\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$, acoustic-mode phonons
below 6 THz are the main heat carriers, while in $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$,
the phonon modes up to 12 THz contribute to the lattice thermal
conductivity. For $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$, $\kappa=77$ is obtained and its
distribution of phonon mode contributions to the lattice thermal
conductivity with respect to phonon frequency closely resembles that for
$\kappa_{xx}$ of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, although the phonon lifetimes of
$\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are half as short as those of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$.

\section{Introduction}
Several nitride insulators are known to exhibit high thermal
conductivity, which is important for heat transfer materials at elevated
temperatures. For example, Slack {\it et al.}\cite{slack} reported that
wurtzite-type AlN has thermal conductivity that exceeds 100 W m$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$. Si$_3$N$_4$ has become another promising thermal conductive
insulator because its thermal conductivity has been improved up to 177 W
m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ through the use of advanced ceramic technologies
related to densification and microstructure
control.\cite{zhou,hirao-rev,watari,hirosaki} The Si$_3$N$_4$ ceramics
also exhibit high mechanical strength at elevated temperatures;
therefore, they are regarded as ideal materials for use in various
applications, such as engine components, gas turbines, and heat sink
substrates of power semiconductor devices.

At atmospheric pressure, Si$_3$N$_4$ has two phases, $\alpha$ and
$\beta$, which are generally considered as low- and high-temperature
phases, respectively.\cite{zhou,hirosaki-md,riley} Their crystal
structures belong to the $P31c$ and $P6_3/m$ space groups,
respectively.\cite{yashima,boulay} These crystal structures are made of
layers that stack along $c$-axis. Each layer is composed of SiN$_4$
tetrahedron units, which is equivalent between these two
phases. However, their manners of the stackings are
different.\cite{hampshire} Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_cryst} depicts these layer
structures from the principal axis direction. They are denoted as A, B,
C, and D in the $\alpha$ phase, and A and B in the $\beta$ phase. The
stacking manners are thus ABCDABCD... and ABAB..., respectively. The
$\alpha$ phase has additional two layer structures of C and D, which are
related to A and B by the $c$ glide operation.\cite{hampshire} Along
$c$-axis, the lattice constant of the $\alpha$ phase is approximately
twice as long as that of the $\beta$ phase.

The experimental thermal conductivities
\cite{zhou,hirao-rev,watari,hirosaki,hirai} of the Si$_3$N$_4$
polymorphs were measured for bulk polycrystalline samples. These values
were significantly affected by the lattice defects, impurities, shapes
and orientations of the constituent crystal grains;\cite{hirosaki-md}
the intrinsic thermal conductivity of defect-free Si$_3$N$_4$ has not
been established. As an experimental approach to determine this, Li {\it
et al.}\cite{li} applied the high-resolution thermoreflectance
microscopy to single $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ grains in a ceramic sample and
they obtained the lattice thermal conductivities of $\kappa_{xx}=69$ and
$\kappa_{zz}=180$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ \textcolor{blue}{at room temperature, }\textcolor{red}{\textbf{How much
tempareture?}} showing large anisotropy of $\kappa_{zz}/\kappa_{xx} \sim
2.6$. \textcolor{red}{For \textcolor{blue}{single-crystal grains of} $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ phases, thermal
conductivity values by experiments are not known. (correct?)}

Hirosaki {\it et al.}\cite{hirosaki-md} theoretically estimated
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ by application of the Green-Kubo formulation to
the molecular dynamics (MD) method with the interatomic potentials
proposed by Vashishta {\it et al.}\cite{vashishta}. They calculated
$\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{zz}$ of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ to be 170 and 450
W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300 K, respectively. Although the calculation
showed much larger $\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{zz}$ than the experimental
values by Li {\it et al.}, the ratio, $\kappa_{zz}/\kappa_{xx} \sim
2.6$, was well reproduced. For $\alpha$-phase, they presented
$\kappa_{xx}=105$ and $\kappa_{zz}=225$ at 300 K, for which the ratio
$\kappa_{zz}/\kappa_{xx} \sim 2.1$ is smaller than that of
$\alpha$-phase. This indicates that the different stacking manners
between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ may result in different anisotropy of
lattice thermal conductivites.%{\cite{hirosaki-md}}
(\textcolor{red}{In
this context, putting the reference is OK? NO.})

Based on first principles phonon calculations and linearized Boltzmann
transport equation\cite{phono3py}, Togo {\it{et al.}} recently
calculated lattice thermal conductivities of compounds with 33 different
chemical compositions that are known to have either zincblende- or
wurtzite-type structures. These crystal structures are only different in
their stacking manners of the densest atomic planes: ABCABC... for
zincblende-type and ABAB... for wurtzite-type. Folowing this fact, in
their calculations, lattice thermal conducitivities of both zincblende-
and wurtzite-type structures were calculated for each chemical
composition and were compared. As a result, it was found that the
different stacking manners differentiate little not only the lattice
thermal conductivities, but the phonon lifetimes and the phonon
densities of states (DOS).\cite{phono3py} Therefore, making crystal
structures have different stacking manners does not always bring the
different lattice thermal conductivities.

In this study, we have investigated the lattice thermal conductivities
of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases of Si$_3$N$_4$ by using the first
principles phonon calculations and linearized Boltzmann transport
equation. This calculation approach has recently become possible to
apply to crystalline phases of compounds systematically due to increase
computer power and efforts on methodological and software developments,
and the calculated values are often more reliable than the other
theoretical approach at this moment. In addition, using this approach,
the microscopic analysis from the phonon picture is easily achieved,
which is important in understanding the mechanism of thermal transport
in crystals. By this, we achieved detailed analysis of lattice thermal
conductivities of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases and discussed about the
different anisotropies of $\kappa_{zz}/\kappa_{xx}$ between them.

In addition to the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, a cubic spinel phase
($\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$) is known to form upon compression and {\it{in
situ}} heating.\cite{zerr,zhang} The reported transition pressures are
scattered from 10 to 36 GPa, depending on the experimental
conditions.\cite{xu} The $\gamma$ phase is experimentally quenched to
atmospheric pressure and room temperature.  The thermal conductivity of
the $\gamma$ phase has not been experimentally reported, although it has
been estimated by the Slack model.\cite{morelli}

The present study aims to qualitatively elucidate the lattice thermal
conductivity tensors among the three Si$_3$N$_4$ phases by a first
principles approach.  We calculate lattice thermal conductivities of the
$\gamma$ phase as well, for systematic understanding. After the
methodology is described, we examine the validity of the present results
through comparison of the calculated thermal properties with the
available experimental and theoretical references.  The characteristic
behaviors of the lattice thermal conductivities are then investigated in
details.

\section{Computational procedures}

\subsection{Lattice thermal conductivity calculation}

The lattice thermal conductivities were calculated by solving the linearized
Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) within the single-mode relaxation time
approximation (single-mode RTA).  The harmonic phonon states and lattice
thermal conductivities were calculated with the phonopy\cite{phonopy} and
phono3py\cite{phono3py} software packages, respectively.  We also attempted the
direct-solution of LBTE\cite{chaput-direct} and give the calculated
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ values in the following section. The difference between
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ calculated by the single-mode RTA and that by the direct
solution was minor for our discussion, for which the detail is given in Sec.
IIc. Therefore, this research was limited to use the single-mode RTA to take
advantage of the closed form of $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$, which can be intuitively
understood in terms of mode-specific phonon properties.

In the following sections, we denote the phonon mode by $\lambda=(\mathbf{q},p)$
with the set of the phonon wave vector $\mathbf{q}$ and band index $p$ and
$-\lambda \equiv (-\mathbf{q},p)$.  The harmonic phonon frequency of the phonon
mode $\lambda$ is denoted by  $\omega_\lambda$.  The band index $p$ is set as 1,
2,... simply in ascending order of the harmonic phonon frequency at a
$\mathbf{q}$-point. For the detailed analysis below, we refer to $e_{j}(i,\lambda)$ as an eigenvector
component for a phonon mode $\lambda$, with respect to a cartesian coordinate
$j$ ($=x,y,z$) of an atom $i$.  The relaxation time due to phonon-phonon scattering
was obtained as,
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}=[2\Gamma_\lambda(\omega_\lambda)]^{-1}$, with
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:linewidth}
 &\Gamma_\lambda(\omega) = \frac{18\pi}{\hbar^2}
  \sum_{\lambda' \lambda''}
  \bigl|\Phi_{-\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}\bigl|^2 N_2(\mathbf{q},\omega).
\end{align}
In this equation, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and
$\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}$ denotes the three-phonon-scattering strength,
obtained by the usual coordinate transformation of third-order force constants
from direct space to phonon space.\cite{phono3py} The second- and third-order
real-space force constants were obtained by {\it ab initio} calculation, of
which the details are given in the next section. $N_2(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ is a
weighted joint DOS (WJDOS)\cite{phono3py},
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:jdos}
 &N_2(\mathbf{q},\omega) = N_2^{(1)}(\mathbf{q},\omega) +  N_2^{(2)}(\mathbf{q},\omega)
\end{align}
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
        N_2^{(1)} & = & \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}} \sum_{\lambda'\lambda''}(n_{\lambda'}-n_{\lambda''})\Delta(-\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{q'} + \mathbf{q''}) \nonumber \\
                                                                   & \times & [\delta(\omega + \omega_{\lambda'} - \omega_{\lambda''}) - \delta(\omega - \omega_{\lambda'} + \omega_{\lambda''})],\\
        N_2^{(2)} & = & \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}} \sum_{\lambda'\lambda''}(n_{\lambda'} + n_{\lambda''}+1)\Delta(-\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{q'} + \mathbf{q''}) \nonumber \\
                                                                   & \times & \delta(\omega - \omega_{\lambda'} - \omega_{\lambda''}),
\end{eqnarray*}
with $\Delta$($\mathbf{x}$) giving 1 if $\mathbf{x}$ is a reciprocal lattice
vector, and otherwise zero. This constraint comes from the lattice
translational invariance that appears inside
$\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}$,\cite{phono3py} however, we let it appear in
$N_2$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:linewidth}) in the same manner as in
Ref.~\onlinecite{sio2}, for the analysis given below. $N_\mathbf{q}$
is the number of $\mathbf{q}$-points.
$n_\lambda=[\exp(\hbar\omega_\lambda/\mathrm{k_B}T)-1]^{-1}$ is
the Bose-Einstein distribution at temperature $T$ with $\mathrm{k_B}$ of Boltzmann constant.

To more realistically compare the  calculated $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ with the
measured thermal conductivities, the isotopic scattering effect due to the natural isotope
distribution was taken into account according to the second-order perturbation
theory.\cite{tamura} Using the relaxation times for the phonon-phonon scattering
and isotopic scattering, $\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}$ and
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{iso}}$, respectively, the total relaxation time for a phonon mode,
$\tau_{\lambda}$, was calculated by assuming Matthiessen's rule,
$1/\tau_{\lambda} = 1/\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}} +
1/\tau_{\lambda,\text{iso}}$.

%The experimental thermal conductivities in the Si$_3$N$_4$ system were
%measured for polycrystalline samples and not from single
%crystals. The conductivities measured in a polycrystalline area were affected
%by various lattice defects within that area, such as grain boundaries, impurities, and
%vacancies. We crudely took them into account by the relaxation time
%$\tau_{\lambda,\text{bs}}=L/|\mathbf{v}_\lambda|$ of a phonon boundary
%scattering model, where $\mathbf{v}_\lambda = \nabla_{\mathbf{q}}\omega_\lambda$
%is the group velocity and $L$ is a parameter related to the boundary mean free
%path. We consider $\tau_{\lambda,\text{bs}}$ as a variable parameter and partly
%include it in the calculated $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$, according to Matthiessen's rule.

The closed form of $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ within the RTA was obtained via
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:kappa}
 \boldsymbol{\kappa} = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}\Omega} \sum_\lambda
 \tau_\lambda \mathbf{v}_\lambda \otimes \mathbf{v}_\lambda c_\lambda,
\end{align}
where $\Omega$ is the unit cell volume,  $\mathbf{v}_\lambda =
\nabla_{\mathbf{q}}\omega_\lambda$ is the group velocity, and $c_\lambda=\frac {\partial (n_\lambda\hbar\omega_\lambda)}{\partial T}$ is
the mode heat capacity. To analyze $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ in detail, the
cumulative thermal conductivity:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:cum-kappa}
 \boldsymbol{\kappa}^\text{c}(\omega) = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}\Omega}
 \int_0^\omega \sum_\lambda
 \tau_\lambda \mathbf{v}_\lambda \otimes \mathbf{v}_\lambda
 c_\lambda \delta(\omega'-\omega_{\lambda})d\omega',
\end{align}
and its derivative $\frac{d
\boldsymbol{\kappa}^\text{c}(\omega)}{d\omega}$:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:dcum-kappa}
 \frac{d\boldsymbol{\kappa}^\text{c}(\omega)}{d\omega} = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}\Omega}
 \sum_\lambda
 \tau_\lambda \mathbf{v}_\lambda \otimes \mathbf{v}_\lambda
 c_\lambda\delta(\omega-\omega_{\lambda}),
\end{align}
were calculated to
determine the phonon mode
contributions to $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$.

\subsection{Computational details}

The force constants required were calculated using the first-principles
projector augmented wave method\cite{paw} (VASP code\cite{vasp-1996,vasp-1995,
vasp-1999}). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof\cite{pbe} was used for the exchange correlation
potential. A plane wave energy cutoff of 500 eV was employed. The crystal
structures were optimized for 0 K and 0 GPa until the residual forces acting on
the constituent atoms were less than $10^{-6}$ eV \AA$^{-1}$. Here, the
temperature and pressure were considered only for the electronic system and the
zero point lattice vibration was not considered. The calculated lattice
parameters were $a=7.808$ {\AA} and $c=5.659$ {\AA} for the $\alpha$ phase,
$a=7.660$ {\AA} and $c=2.925$ {\AA} for the $\beta$ phase, and $a=7.787$ {\AA}
for the $\gamma$ phase, \textcolor{blue}{while the experimental values are
	reported as $a=7.7545$ {\AA} and $c=5.62145$ {\AA} for the $\alpha$
phase\cite{yashima}, $a=7.6044$ {\AA} and $c=2.9063$ {\AA} for the $\beta$
phase\cite{boulay}, and $a=7.7351$ {\AA} for the $\gamma$
phase\cite{paszkowicz}. The present results} are in agreement with the
experimental data within +0.7 \% error. The lattice volume optimized with the
local density approximation (LDA) \textcolor{blue}{according to Ceperly and
Alder as parameterized by Perdew and Zunger\cite{lda,lda-pz}} was, for
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, 3 \% smaller than the volume optimized with GGA, which is a
typical volume contraction of LDA.  $\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{zz}$ calculated
with LDA were larger by 0.3 and 2.6 \% than those calculated with GGA. For our
discussion, these differences are sufficiently small; therefore, the impact of
the choice of exchange correlation potential is considered to be minor in this
study.

The force constants were calculated by the finite difference
approach\cite{wei-supercell}. For this calculation, the following supercells
were adopted: $1\times 1\times2$, $1\times 1\times3$, and $1\times 1\times1$
supercells of the conventional unit cells for the calculations of the
third-order force constants of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$,
respectively, and $3\times 3\times4$, $3\times 3\times8$ and $2\times 2\times2$
for those of the second-order force constants.  The length of the induced atomic
displacements was set to 0.03 \AA.  Table \ref{table:LTC} shows
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ calculated with several different sets of the supercells,
which indicates that the calculated $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ has reasonable
convergence with respect to the size of the supercells.

Uniform $\mathbf{k}$-point sampling meshes of $4\times 4\times 2$, $4\times
4\times 3$, and $3\times 3\times 3$ were employed for calculations of the
third-order force constants of the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases. For
the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, the center of the $a^*b^*$ plane was sampled,
while the center on the $c^*$-axis was not. For the $\gamma$ phase, a non-$\Gamma$
center mesh was used. For the calculations of the second-order force constants,
the $\Gamma$-point was only sampled for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$
phases, and the
only one $\mathbf{k}=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)$ point was sampled for the $\gamma$ phase.
The $\mathbf{q}$-point sampling meshes of $10\times 10\times 14$, $10\times
10\times 26$, and \textcolor{blue}{$18\times 18\times 18$} were employed to calculate
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:kappa}) for the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$\gamma$ phases, respectively.

Non-analytical term correction\cite{wang} was applied to the second-order force
constants to take into account the long range Coulombic forces present in ionic
crystals. For the correction, static dielectric constants and Born effective
charges were calculated using the density functional perturbation theory
as implemented in the VASP code\cite{vasp-lepsiron,lepsiron}.

The effect of lattice thermal expansion on $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ was examined
by the calculation of $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ for several finite
temperatures with the crystal structures optimized for the
corresponding temperatures within the quasi-harmonic approximation
(QHA)\cite{dove-p76}. These $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ were different from those
calculated for the same temperatures with the structure
optimized for 0 K. We consider these differences as the effect of lattice
thermal expansion. The differences in $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ for $T$=300, 600,
900, 1200, and, 1500 K, for the $\beta$ phase, were within 1 \%. They
were similar to those for Si and Ge calculated by Ward {\it{et
al.}}\cite{ward-ltc}.
For the present study, these differences are negligible and
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ calculated with the
structure optimized for 0 K was adopted.


The volumetric thermal expansion coefficients were also calculated.
Comparison with the experimental coefficient is useful to validate the present
thermal conductivity calculation because both the thermal expansion
and $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ originate from the anharmonicity of the interatomic
potential.
The calculated coefficients of the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases were
4.31$\times 10^{-6}$,  4.19$\times 10^{-6}$, and 1.13$\times 10^{-5}$
K$^{-1}$
for 300 K, while the experimental values\cite{minikayev-alpha, gamma-expand}
were 3.75$\times 10^{-6}$ , 3.55$\times 10^{-6}$, and 9.48$\times
10^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$. The calculation systematically overestimated the experimental
values, but reproduced the experimental tendencies, including that the $\alpha$
phase has a slightly larger coefficient than the $\beta$
phase. This supports the validity of the present calculation to qualitatively
compare the calculated $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ among the Si$_3$N$_4$ phases.

To compare the microscopic phonon properties among the three phases under the
same conditions, the results calculated at 0 GPa are shown and discussed.  For
the $\gamma$ phase, this means that we assume the condition of a virtually
quenched $\gamma$ phase at 0 GPa from the high pressure. To examine the
analytical continuity of the properties with respect to pressure,
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ of the $\gamma$ phase was calculated at 10, 20, and 40
GPa, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S1}. The phenomenological behavior of the linear
dependence of $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ with respect to the pressure was reproduced,
similar to that in Ref.~\onlinecite{andersson-pressure}. The slope was 2.89
W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ GPa$^{-1}$ for the $\gamma$ phase.  From this dependence, we
consider that the microscopic values are also varied smoothly with the pressure
and those at 0 GPa are valuable for comparison with the corresponding values of
the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases.

\subsection{Direct solution of LBTE}

The advantage of employing the single-mode RTA for thermal conductivity
calculations is the closed form in Eq.~(\ref{eq:kappa}), by which the qualitative character of
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ can be intuitively understood in terms of the phonon-mode
specific properties. The microscopic understanding of the full solution of LBTE
is still under development,\cite{cepellotti-relaxons} and the microscopic
picture based on collective phonons\cite{hardy-collective} will require more
complicated investigation.

Single-mode RTA solutions of LBTE often underestimate the full
solution.\cite{mukhopadhyay-ltc,ward-ltc} To check this underestimation,
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases were calculated by the
direct solution of LBTE\cite{chaput-direct}, which is one of the methods of LBTE
full solutions. $\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{zz}$ without the isotope effect were
69 and 102 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for the $\alpha$ phase, and 76 and 238
W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for the $\beta$ phase, respectively, while the corresponding
single-mode RTA values were 70 and 102 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for the $\alpha$ phase,
and 76 and 210 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for the $\beta$ phase. $\kappa_{zz}$ for the
$\beta$ phase from the direct solution was 13 \% larger than that of the
single-mode RTA solution. The differences in $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ between the
LBTE solutions are not significant; therefore, we expect that the physics of
these lattice thermal conductivities is well understood within the
single-mode RTA at the current level of our interest. Therefore, we discuss the
lattice thermal conductivities calculated by the single-mode RTA solution.

Table~\ref{table:LTC-exp} shows the calculated
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ for 300 K with the isotope effect. $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ has a markedly more
anisotropic $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ than $\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$.  The directional
averages $\sum_i \kappa_{ii}/3$  are 79, 115,  and 77 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for the
$\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases, respectively. The value for the
$\gamma$ phase is similar to that for the $\alpha$ phase, despite the
comparatively large difference among the bulk moduli ($B$) that are also shown
in Table~\ref{table:LTC-exp}.

Table~\ref{table:LTC-exp} also lists the previously reported
experimental\cite{li} and theoretical\cite{hirosaki-md} $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$
for reference. The theoretical results\cite{morelli} of the Slack model, which
do not include the anisotropy in $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$, are shown as $\kappa$ in
Table~\ref{table:LTC-exp}. Compared to the $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ from
MD\cite{hirosaki-md}, our $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ for the $\beta$ phase has better
agreement with the experimental $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$.  Compared to $\kappa$
from the Slack model, our directional average $\sum_i \kappa_{ii}/3$ is also
much closer to the experimental average.

Fig.~\ref{fig:kaccum} shows the cumulative thermal conductivity,
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}^c(\omega)$, with the isotope effect.  From this figure, it
is evident that in the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases, the phonon modes
with their frequencies up to $\sim$ 6, 12 and 10 THz largely contribute to each
respective $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$. Thus we investigate the phonon modes
in these frequency ranges.

\subsection{Distribution of group velocity in Brillouin zone}

The Brillouin zones and phonon band diagrams of the three phases are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}~(a). In this figure, we investigate the
gradient of $\omega_\lambda$, the group velocity projected on the paths along the nonequivalent
axes of the reciprocal lattice. We particularly focus on the anisotropy of the
group velocity in the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases. This was not investigated
in the previous works\cite{kuwabara,xu}. The band diagrams on the other high-symmetry paths are
almost identical to those reported\cite{kuwabara,xu} and thus are not shown.
For the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, in order to investigate the distribution of
the group velocities all over the Brillouin zone, the cross-sections of the
phonon frequency distributions for the band indices $p$=1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}~(b). As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:kaccum}, the
frequencies for these band indicies cover a large part of the frequency ranges
where $\boldsymbol{\kappa}^c$ increase significantly. The cross-sections are on the $b^*c^*$ plane.
There were negligible differences among the cross-sections on the planes
containing $c^*$ axis, we focus on the $b^*c^*$ plane as a representative of all
such planes.
The A-$\Gamma$ and $\Gamma$-K paths of the band diagram
respectively correspond to the left and bottom end lines in the
cross-section area.
Thus, the distribution profiles on the end lines appear in  the
dispersion curves in the band diagrams.
Just for clarification purposes, the dispersion curves
corresponding to the profiles for $p$=4 are highlighted by gray color.

In the band diagram of the $\alpha$ phase, the dispersion relation on the
A-$\Gamma$ path for a band index is similar to that on the K-$\Gamma$ path.
This suggests nearly isotropic group velocities, which is more clearly seen in
the cross-sections for $p$=1, 2 and 3, where the most of the contour lines are
nearly parallel to the circular dash lines inserted as a guide.  In contrast, in
the band diagram of the $\beta$ phase, the dispersion relation is much more
different between the two paths. For example, the frequencies of the
acoustic-mode phonons at the A point are much higher
than those at the K point.
Consistently, the gradients of frequencies

                           and 4) are shown. In the band diagrams for the $\alpha$ and
                           $\beta$ phases, the dispersion curve for $p$=4 is denoted by a thick gray line.

\noindent
in the cross-sections are, in the
most part, parallel to the vertical edges; the group velocities orient closely
to the $c^*$ axis direction.
This difference in group velocities between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases is due to the A-$\Gamma$
path lengths. The $\beta$ phase has an approximately twice longer path than the
$\alpha$ phase; the lattice constant $c$ of the $\beta$ phase is nearly half
that of the $\alpha$ phase, owing to the different stacking manners of the basal
layer structures (Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_cryst}).  Comparing the cross-sections for
$p$=4 between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, the $\beta$
phase has larger gradients of frequencies than the $\alpha$ phase.  Comparing the
band diagrams of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, the same tendency is also seen
for the most of the other optical phonon modes.

In the $\gamma$ phase, the dispersion curve for the longitudinal acoustic
mode-phonons is almost linear. Their frequencies at the L point is much higher than the
longitudinal acoustic phonon frequencies at the A or K points of the $\alpha$
and $\beta$ phases.  The gradients of the acoustic phonon branches near the
$\Gamma$ point are the largest among the three phases, as expected by the
largest $B$.

\subsection{Microscopic analysis on $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ behavior}

In the previous section, we have investigated the anisotropy in
$\mathbf{v}_\lambda$, which may explain the anisotropy in $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$.
Here we examine which terms in Eq.(\ref{eq:kappa}) characterize the behavior of
the calculated $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$. In the following, we omit the term of mode
heat capacity because it is approximately constant for the phonon modes that
mainly carry heat at 300 K. For simplicity, the effect of isotope scattering is
not considered in this section.
For the investigation, the derivative of
cumulative thermal conductivity, $d\boldsymbol{\kappa}^c/d\omega$ in
Eq.(\ref{eq:dcum-kappa}), is shown at the top of Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}.

Assuming that $\tau_\lambda$ and $\mathbf{v}_\lambda$ are constant, then
$d\kappa_{ii}^c/d\omega$ ($ii$=$xx,zz$) are proportional to the phonon
DOS:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:dos}
 g(\omega) = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}}
 \sum_\lambda
 \delta(\omega-\omega_{\lambda}).
\end{align}
We refer to $g(\omega)/\Omega$ as a frequency distribution of a heat
carrier density. Alternatively, assuming that only $\tau_\lambda$ is constant,
then $d\boldsymbol{\kappa}^c/d\omega$ is proportional to:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:wdos}
 \boldsymbol{h}(\omega) = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}\Omega}
 \sum_\lambda
 \mathbf{v}_\lambda \otimes \mathbf{v}_\lambda
 \delta(\omega-\omega_{\lambda}),
\end{align}
from which we examine the impacts of both of $\mathbf{v}_\lambda$ and the heat carrier
density. $g(\omega)/\Omega$ and  $\boldsymbol{h}(\omega)$
are shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}~(b) and (c). As for the frequency
variation of $\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}$, scatter
plots of $(\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}},\omega_\lambda)$ are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}~(d).

Comparison of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases indicates their phonon lifetimes
distributions are qualitatively similar, except for a striking difference below
$\sim$ 5 THz, which will be examined later. The markedly different
$d\kappa_{ii}^c/d\omega$ between the two phases are therefore ascribed to the
corresponding $h_{ii}$. The overall spectral shapes of $g(\omega)/\Omega$ are also
similar between the two phases; therefore, $\mathbf{v}_\lambda$ alone accounts
for the different behavior of $d\kappa_{ii}^c/d\omega$. It is thus concluded
that the different anisotropy in $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ can be qualitatively
explained by the different $\mathbf{v}_\lambda$.
In contrast, for the zincblende and wurtzite
structures, the group velocities of these structures are suggested to be similar from their band
structures\cite{phono3py}.
This must result in similar $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ between these
structures, irrespective of the stacking manner.

The $\gamma$ phase has much different $g(\omega)/\Omega$, $\boldsymbol{h}(\omega)$,
and, $\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}$ from the other phases, as expected from the
large differences in their crystal structures. The most significant difference
is in the phonon lifetimes. For 4 THz $\lesssim\omega_\lambda\lesssim$ 10 THz,
the phonon lifetimes are approximately half as short as those of the other
phases. We will examine this in detail later. As a result,
$d\kappa_{xx}^c/d\omega$ has relatively low intensities. The longitudinal
acoustic phonon branch increases its frequencies much significantly, as we have
examined in the band diagram; therefore, $d\kappa_{xx}^c/d\omega$ rather
gradually attenuates as the frequency increases, occasionally resembling
$d\kappa_{xx}^c/d\omega$ of the $\beta$ phase.

\subsection{Phonon properties characterizing $\tau_{\lambda,ph-ph}$}

The distribution of phonon lifetimes is qualitatively similar between the $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ phases, although their group velocities have marked differences. This
remains a curiosity.
Recalling Eq.~(\ref{eq:linewidth}), $\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}$ in the
present form is dependent on WJDOS
and $|\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}|^2$. We examine these terms one-by-one.

\begin{figure}[ht]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figure_wjdoss_gray.pdf} \caption{
          WJDOS of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ at different $\mathbf
          q$ points and that of $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$ at the $\Gamma$ point.
  The WJDOS for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases in the  first and fourth rows
  are calculated at the same $\Gamma$-point but
  with the polarization for the non-analytic term correction set along $c^*$ and
  $b^*$, respectively. \label{fig:Fig6_338} }
 \centering
\end{figure}

The frequency profiles of WJDOS in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig6_338} are very similar between the $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ phases, for each different $\mathbf{q}$-points.  Their intensities are
scaled with $Z^2$ of which $Z$ is the number of formula units in the primitive
unit cell, to compare WJDOS for structures with different $Z$.  These profiles
show weak $\mathbf{q}$-point dependences.  The frequency profile for the
$\gamma$ phase is only shown at $\mathbf{q}=(0,0,0)$ because of the different
shape of the Brillouin zone from those in the other phases.  We checked that
the $\mathbf{q}$ dependence of WJDOS for the $\gamma$ phase was as weak as
those shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig6_338} for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases.
The intensities of WJDOS below $\sim$ 10 THz in the $\gamma$ phase are slightly smaller than those in
the other phases.


\begin{table}[ht]
 \caption{\label{table:aveavepp} Averages of
 $|\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}|^2$ over frequency ranges of
 $\omega_\lambda$ (0--15 and 0--35 THz) and all ($\lambda'$,$\lambda''$). The
 values are in units of meV$^2$.}
 \begin{ruledtabular}
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
   \multirow{2}{*}{Frequency range (THz)}
   & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Phase}  \\
   \cline{2-4} & $\alpha$ & $\beta$ & $\gamma$ \\

   \multirow{1}{*}{0--35} & 2.30 & 2.30 & 2.02
  \end{tabular}
 \end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}

As for $|\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}|^2$, in Table.~\ref{table:aveavepp},
they are averaged over two frequency ranges of 0--15 or 0--35 THz for
$\omega_\lambda$ and all indices in $\lambda'$ and $\lambda''$.  The frequency
ranges for $\omega_\lambda$ were set so that the narrower frequency range
approximately corresponds to the range where the phonon modes largely contribute
to $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$. A small change in the frequency range by a few
terahertz did not change the qualitative characteristics of the averages.  To
compare the averages among the phases having different $Z$, as in
Ref.~\onlinecite{sio2} we multiply the average by $(3n_a)^2$ where $n_a$ is the
number of atoms in the primitive unit cell. The averages are very similar for
the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases. With the similar impact of the WJDOS and
$|\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}|^2$, the phonon lifetimes in these phases are
also similar. For the $\gamma$ phase, the short $\tau_\lambda$ are attributed to
the large $|\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}|^2$ in the narrower frequency range
for $\omega_\lambda$.

           \centering
\end{figure}

Finally, we examine the striking difference in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}~(d)
below $\sim$ 5 THz between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases.
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig7_338} enlarges that part.  In the $\alpha$ phase,
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}$ below $\sim$ 5 THz are distributed around a single
smooth line, while for the $\beta$ phase, they are scattered much more largely.
In this figure, each plot is shown with a color specified by
$\sum_{i}[e_x(i,\lambda)^2+e_y(i,\lambda)^2]$, the fraction of the eigenvector
component parallel to the $ab$ plane.

From Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig7_338}, we find that, for the $\beta$ phase,
a phonon mode of the atomic vibration parallel to the $ab$ plane is more hindered by
the other phonons than a phonon mode of the vibration
perpendicular to the plane.
A straight line is inserted in the graph for $\beta$ phase in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig7_338}.  The numbers of the phonon modes below and above the
line are 145 and 67, whose ratio is reasonable as the population ratio between
the two groups of the phonon modes whose atomic vibrations are, respectively,
parallel and perpendicular to the $ab$ plane.


\section{Summary}

In the present study, the lattice thermal conductivities of the
three Si$_3$N$_4$ phases were investigated using lattice dynamics based on the
first-principles interatomic force constants. The main remarks are as follows:

1) In $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, of which the crystal structures are
characterized by the stacking manner of the basal layer structures,
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ is largely altered due to the differences in the harmonic
band structures induced by the different stacking manners. This is in contrast
with the zincblende and wurtzite structures in the previous
study\cite{phono3py}. $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ for $\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$ is rather
isotropic, while $\kappa$$_{zz}$ for the $\beta$ phase is twice or more larger
than the other $\kappa_{ii}$ of the three phases.

2) In the $\alpha$ phase, the acoustic-mode phonons below 6 THz are the main
heat carriers, while in the $\beta$ phase, the phonons below 12 THz contribute
to $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$. Their group velocities are confirmed to characterize
the behavior of $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$.

3) In the $\gamma$ phase, the frequency distribution of the phonon mode
contributions to $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ is similar to that for $\kappa_{xx}$ of
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, which is attributed to its large phonon-phonon scattering
strength and steep longitudinal acoustic branches.
