\begin{abstract}
Lattice thermal conductivities of $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and
$\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$ single crystals are investigated from {\it
ab-initio} anharmonic lattice dynamics, within the single-mode
relaxation-time approximation of the linearized phonon Boltzmann
transport equation. At 300 K, the lattice thermal conductivity of
$\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$ is calculated as $\kappa_{xx}=69$ and
$\kappa_{zz}=99$ (in units of Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$). For
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, $\kappa_{xx}=73$ and $\kappa_{zz}=198$ are
obtained, that is consistent with the reported experimental values of 69
and 180, respectively. The difference of anisotropy between
$\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ is originated from their
characteristic difference in the phonon band structures, although their
crystal structures are similar in their local atomic coordinates. In
$\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$, acoustic-mode phonons below 6 THz are the main
heat carriers. In $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, the phonon modes up to 12 THz
contribute to the lattice thermal conductivity.
%
In $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$, $\kappa=81$ is obtained. The distribution of
phonon mode contributions to lattice thermal conductivity along phonon
frequency is found to closely resemble $\kappa_{xx}$ of
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ although the phonon lifetimes of
$\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are twice shorter than those of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$.

\section{Introduction}
Several nitride insulators exhibiting good thermal conductivities are important
for heat sink materials used at elevated temperatures. Wurtzite-type w-AlN,
which has an Adamantine (diamond-like) crystal structure, was noted by Slack
{\it et al.}~\cite{slack} as a superior thermal conductor over 100 WK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$.
Si$_3$N$_4$ has been more recently recognized as one of the good thermally
conductive insulators. Remarkable advances in ceramic technologies related to
the densification of the sintered body and microstructural control have pushed
the thermal conductivities of polycrystalline of Si$_3$N$_4$ ceramics up to 177
WK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$.~\cite{zhou,hirao,watari,hirosaki} Since Si$_3$N$_4$ ceramics
also exhibit high mechanical strength at elevated temperatures, they are
regarded as ideal for use in various applications, such as engine components,
gas turbines, and heat sink substrates of power semiconductor devices.

At atmospheric pressure, Si$_3$N$_4$ exists in one of two phases, $\alpha$ and
$\beta$, both in the hexagonal lattice system, which are generally considered
to be low- and high-temperature phases,
respectively.~\cite{zhou,hirosaki,riley} Their crystal structures are commonly
formed by stacking of basal layers of SiN$_4$ tetrahedra.  The stacking manners
in $\alpha$ and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are as ABCDABCD.. and ABAB.., respectively.
This difference is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_cryst} from the principal
axis direction.  The CD layers are related to AB by the c glide operation,
~\cite{hampshire} along which the unit cell periodicity of the $\alpha$ phase
is approximately two times longer than that of the $\beta$ phase, with lattice
constants of c = 5.62~\cite{yashima} and 2.91~\cite{boulay} \AA, respectively.
In addition to these phases, a cubic spinel phase ($\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$) can be
formed upon compression and in-situ heating.~\cite{zerr,zhang} The reported
transition pressures were scattered from 10 to 36 GPa depending on the
experimental conditions.  The produced $\gamma$ phase can be experimentally
quenched to atmospheric pressure and room temperature.

By using high-resolution thermoreflectance microscopy, Li {\it et
al.}~\cite{li} reported that the thermal conductivities of individual
rod-shaped $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ grains in a ceramic were 69 and 180
Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ along the $a$ and $c$ axes, respectively, and thus suggested
the large anisotropy in thermal conductivity.  Takahashi {\it et al.}
~\cite{takahashi} have recently developed a technique whereby
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ grains are coated with graphene of relatively high magnetic
susceptibility, enabling them to align their $c$ axes along the external
magnetic field.  Based on this technique, it has been proposed that the
textural structure of rod-shaped $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ grains would increase
their thermal conductivity to a level matching or exceeding that of w-AlN.

Although the fabrication of millimeter-sized $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ single
crystals has been reported~\cite{yamamoto}, the thermal conductivity of no
isolated single crystal of any Si$_3$N$_4$ phase has yet been experimentally
determined.  It was proposed~\cite{watari-trans} that the anisotropy in the
thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ phase grains may not stem from the
intrinsic crystal properties, but rather, from the selective removal of crystal
defects along the $c$ axis of the grains.  Theoretically, Hirosaki {\it et
al.}~\cite{hirosaki-md} estimated the room-temperature lattice thermal
conductivities (LTCs) $\kappa$$_{xx}$ and $\kappa$$_{zz}$ of
$\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$ to be 105 and 225 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, and $\kappa$$_{zz}$
of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ to be 170 and 450 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, respectively, by
applying the Green-Kubo formulation to the molecular dynamics (MD) method with
the interatomic potentials proposed by Vashishta {\it et al.} The ratio of the
LTCs in the $\beta$ phase along the $a$ and $c$ axes agreed well with the
experimental results obtained by Li {\it et al.}; however, the absolute values
were more than two times larger than the experimental results.  The MD results
suggest that the different stacking orders in $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$
alter much their LTC, although the recent LTC calculation using first
principles interatomic force constants (IFCs) has shown that in many polymorphs of the wurtzite
and zincblende structures, which differ in terms of the stacking order of the
densest atom planes as ABAB.. and ABCABC.., the stacking orders merely alter
the LTCs.~\cite{phono3py} For $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$, its thermal conductivity
has not been experimentally reported; it has been estimated only by the Slack
model.~\cite{morelli} In short, while the thermal conductivity of
polycrystalline $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ has been significantly
improved~\cite{zhou,hirao,watari,hirosaki}, our basic knowledge of, for
example, the thermal conductivity tensors of the different Si$_3$N$_4$
crystalline phases remains insufficient.

The present study aims to qualitatively understand the LTC tensors among the
three Si$_3$N$_4$ phases by means of the first principles approach.  After the
methodology section, we examine the validity of the present LTC results first.
Then we investigate the characteristics in the LTCs in detail.

\section{Computational procedures}
\subsection{Lattice thermal conductivity calculation}
The LTCs were calculated by solving the linearized Boltzmann transport equation
(LBTE) within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (single-mode RTA).
We also tried the direct-solution of LBTE~\cite{chaput-direct} and shortly
leave its calculated LTC values in the following section. However the
difference of LTCs between by the single-mode RTA and by the direct solution
was found minor for our discussion.  Therefore we limited our research based on
the single-mode RTA to take advantage of the intuitive closed form of LTCs with
the single-mode RTA.  In the following sections, we denote a phonon mode by
$\lambda=(\mathbf{q},p)$ by the set of the phonon wave vector $\mathbf{q}$ and
band index $p$. The relaxation time due to phonon-phonon scattering was
obtained as reciprocal of linewidth,
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}=(2\Gamma_\lambda)^{-1}$, where the linewidth that
we employed in this study is as follows:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:linewidth}
 &\Gamma_\lambda = \frac{18\pi}{\hbar^2}
  \sum_{\lambda' \lambda''}
  \bigl|\Phi_{-\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}\bigl|^2 \times \nonumber \\ 
 &\left\{ (n_{\lambda'} + n_{\lambda''}+1) 
   \delta(\omega_\lambda-\omega_{\lambda'}-\omega_{\lambda''}) \right.
   + \nonumber \\ 
 &\;\;(n_{\lambda'}-n_{\lambda''})
  \left[\delta(\omega_\lambda +\omega_{\lambda'}-\omega_{\lambda''})
 \right. 
 \left. -\left. \delta(\omega_\lambda - \omega_{\lambda'}+\omega_{\lambda''})
 \right]\right\}.
\end{align}
Here $\omega_\lambda$ is the harmonic phonon frequency of the phonon mode
$\lambda$, $n_\lambda=[\exp(\hbar\omega_\lambda/\mathrm{k_B}T)-1]^{-1}$ shows
the Bose-Einstein distribution at temperature $T$, and
$\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}$ denotes the three-phonon-scattering strength.
$\Phi_{\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}$ was obtained by usual coordinate
transformation of third-order IFCs from direct space to phonon
space.~\cite{phono3py} The second- and third-order real-space IFCs
were obtained from the ab-initio calculation, whose details are written in the
next section.

In order to compare the more realistic results of the calculated LTC with the
experimental data, the isotopic scattering effect due to the natural isotope
distribution was taken into account according to the second-order perturbation
theory.~\cite{tamura} With the relaxation times of the phonon-phonon scattering
and isotropic scattering, $\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}}$ and
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{iso}}$, the total relaxation time for a phonon mode was
assumed to be $1/\tau_{\lambda} = 1/\tau_{\lambda,\text{ph-ph}} +
1/\tau_{\lambda,\text{iso}}$, according to Matthiessen's rule.

These LTCs were calculated with the phonon-phonon interaction calculation code
PHONO3PY~\cite{phono3py}, while the harmonic phonon states were analyzed with
the phonon calculation code PHONOPY~\cite{phonopy}. These codes have been
developed and maintained by the authors in this study.

The available experimental thermal conductivity data of the Si$_3$N$_4$ system
have been measured on the polycrystalline samples and not measured from any
single crystals. In order to consider the effect of various lattice defects in
the polycrystalline samples, such as grain boundaries, impurities, and
vacancies, we crudely took them into account by a relaxation time
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{bs}}=L/|\mathbf{v}_\lambda|$ of a phonon boundary
scattering model, where $\mathbf{v}_\lambda =
\nabla_{\mathbf{q}}\omega_\lambda$ is the group velocity and $L$ a
parameter regarding to the boundary mean free path. We consider
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{bs}}$ as a variable parameter and included it to
LTCs according to Matthiessen's rule.

The closed form of the LTC tensors within RTA were obtained via
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:kappa}
 \boldsymbol{\kappa}(T) = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}\Omega} \sum_\lambda
 \tau_\lambda(T) \mathbf{v}_\lambda \otimes \mathbf{v}_\lambda c_\lambda(T),
\end{align}
where $N_\mathbf{q}$ is the number of
$\mathbf{q}$-points, $\Omega$ is the unit cell volume, and $c_\lambda$
is the mode heat capacity. To analyze the LTC in detail, we calculate
the cumulative thermal conductivity:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:cum-kappa}
 \boldsymbol{\kappa}^\text{c}(\omega) = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}\Omega}
 \int_0^\omega \sum_\lambda
 \tau_\lambda(T) \mathbf{v}_\lambda \otimes \mathbf{v}_\lambda
 c_\lambda(T) \delta(\omega'-\omega)d\omega'.
\end{align}

\subsection{Computational details}
The IFCs were calculated using the first-principles projector
augmented wave method~\cite{paw} (VASP code~\cite{vasp-1996,vasp-1995,
vasp-1999}). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof~\cite{pbe} was used for the exchange correlation
potential. A plane wave energy cutoff of 500 eV was employed. The crystal
structures were optimized until the convergence in the residual forces acting
on the constituent atoms was less than $10^{-6}$ eV/\AA. The structural
optimization was firstly performed for a temperature of 0 K and 0 GPa. Here the
temperature and pressure were considered only for the electronic system and the
zero point lattice vibration was not taken into account. The calculated lattice
parameters were $a=7.808$ \AA~ and $c=5.659$ \AA~ for the $\alpha$ phase,
$a=7.660$ \AA~ and $c=2.925$ \AA~ for the $\beta$ phase, and $a=7.787$ \AA~
for the $\gamma$ phase, which agree with the experimental
data~\cite{yashima,boulay,paszkowicz-gSi3N4} within +0.7 \% errors. The lattice
volume optimized at 0 K and 0 GPa within the local density approximation
(LDA)~\cite{lda} for the exchange correlation potential was, for
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, 3 \% smaller than the volume with GGA, which is a typical
volume contraction of LDA. In our test using $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ at 0 K and 0
GPa, the LTC calculated with LDA was larger by 2.6 \% than that with GGA. For
our discussion, these difference is enough small, therefore the impact of
choice of exchange correlation potential is considered to be minor in our
study.

Supercell and finite difference approaches were used to calculate the
IFCs.~\cite{wei-supercell} The $1\times 1\times2$, $1\times 1\times3$, and $1\times
1\times1$ supercells of the conventional unit cells were adopted for the
third-order IFCs of the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases,
respectively, while the larger supercells $3\times 3\times4$, $3\times
3\times8$ and $2\times 2\times2$ were adopted for the respective
second-order IFCs. The constant atomic displacement distance was set to
0.03 \AA. Table \ref{table:LTC} shows the calculated LTC values for
several different choices of supercell sizes, indicating that our
calculated LTCs are reasonably converging with respect to the supercell
sizes.

Uniform $\mathbf{k}$-point sampling meshes of $4\times 4\times 2$,
$4\times 4\times 3$, and $3\times 3\times 3$ were used for the
third-order IFCs of the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases. For the
former two phases the center of the $a^*$-$b^*$ plane were sampled
though the off-center grids along $c^*$-axis were sampled. For the
$\gamma$ phase, non-$\Gamma$ center mesh was used. For the second-order
IFC, the $\Gamma$-point was only sampled for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$
phase supercells and the only one $\mathbf{k}=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)$ point was
sampled for the $\gamma$ phase supercell. The $\mathbf{q}$-point
sampling meshes of $10\times 10\times 14$, $10\times 10\times 26$, and
$12\times 12\times 12$ were used to calculate the LTCs in Eq.~(\ref{eq:kappa})
for the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases.

To compare the calculated LTC with the experimental data measured at
finite temperatures, the experimentally measured lattice parameters may 
be preferred in case that they are known. We examined LTC of
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ at the equilibrium volumes ($V_\text{eq}(T)$) within the
quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA).~\cite{dove-p76} Except for this, the LTC values
were calculated with the equilibrium volume at 0 K ($V_\text{eq}(T=0)$).

We calculated volumetric thermal expansion coefficients and compared them with
the reported experimental values so as to check the validity of the present
calculation, because the thermal expansion is originated from the anharmonicity
of the interatomic potential as well as lattice thermal conduction. The
calculated values are 4.31 and 4.19 ($10^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$) at 300 K for the
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, while the experimental values were 3.75 and 3.55
($10^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$)~\cite{minikayev-alpha}. The present calculation reproduced
the experimental tendency where the $\alpha$ phase has a slightly larger
thermal expansion coefficient than the $\beta$ phase, supporting that the
present calculations enable us to qualitatively compare the LTC values of the
Si$_3$N$_4$ phases.

In order to compare the microscopic phonon properties among the three phases at
the same conditions, those results calculated at 0 GPa are shown and discussed.
For the $\gamma$ phase, this means that we assume the condition of virtually
quenched $\gamma$ phase at 0 GPa from the high pressure. To examine this, we
calculated LTC of $\gamma$ phase at 10, 20, and 40 GPa as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:S1}, where the phenomenological behaviour of linear dependence of
LTC with respect to pressure with the calculated slope of 2.89
Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$GPa$^{-1}$ was reproduced as similar to
ref.~\onlinecite{andersson-pressure}. By this result, we consider that the
microscopic values are also varied smoothly with the pressure and those at 0
GPa are meaningful to compare with the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases.

\subsection{Direct solution of LBTE}
The merit of the single-mode RTA is that we can intuitively understand the
qualitative character of LTC in terms of the relaxation time and group
velocity. The microscopic understanding of the full solution of LBTE is still
under the development~\cite{cepellotti-relaxons} and the microscopic picture
based on collective phonons~\cite{hardy-collective}) will require more
complicate investigation although it is known that the single-mode RTA solution
of LBTE underestimates the full solution.~\cite{mukhopadhyay-ltc,ward-ltc}


For the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, we partly adopted a direct solution of
LBTE~\cite{chaput-direct}, which is one of the methods of LBTE full solutions.
The LTC values of the direct solution without the isotope effect were  69 and
102 WK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ for$\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{zz}$  of the $\alpha$ phase
and 76 and 238 for those of the $\beta$ phase, respectively, while the
corresponding single-mode RTA values were 70 and 102 WK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ for the
α phase and 76 and 210 WK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ for the $\beta$ phase. The
$\kappa_{zz}$ of the direct solution in the $\beta$ phase was 13 \% larger than
that of the single-mode RTA solution. Since the LTC difference between the LBTE
solutions is not significant and we expect the physics on LTC is well
understood within RTA in the current level of our interest.

In Table \ref{table:LTC-exp}, the theoretical LTCs at 300 K are compared with
the previously reported experimental~\cite{hirosaki,hirai,li,slack-aln} and
theoretical~\cite{morelli,hirosaki-md,phono3py} values. The present calculation
results better agree with the experimental $\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{zz}$ of
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$, compared
with the references of the Slack model~\cite{morelli} and MD~\cite{hirosaki-md}
results. The directional averages of the present κii in the $\alpha$, $\beta$,
and $\gamma$ phases are 79, 115, and 81 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. The value of the
$\gamma$ phase is just as small as that of the $\alpha$ phase, although the
former phase shows the largest bulk modulus ($B$) in Table \ref{table:LTC-exp}.
It is generally known that simple models through Debye temperature can provide
only their rough estimations.

It can be seen that the theoretical LTCs of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are markedly
more anisotropic than those of the $\alpha$ phase. The theoretical LTCs of
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental
data for individual grains reported by Li {\it et al.}~\cite{li}, indicating
that the experimentally reported large anisotropy in the thermal conductivities
of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ stems from the intrinsic properties of the crystal,
rather than specific defects induced during the sample preparation process.
Among the nitrides studied, the theoretical LTC of $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ along
the c axis (194 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) is the closest to the values for
high-thermal-conductivity AlN. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_338} shows the theoretical LTCs of the $\alpha$  and $\beta$
phases as a function of $T$, in comparison with the reference experimental
data, which were measured from the polycrystalline samples. The data of the
polycrystalline bulk samples cannot be directly compared with the theoretical
LTC tensors because the microstructures of the bulk samples affect the thermal
conductivities.  We calculate theoretical LTC values of the polycrystalline
bulk sample as $\kappa = w\kappa_{xx} + (1-w) \kappa_{zz}$, with an adjustable
parameter $w$ between 0 and 1 for the least square differences from the
experimental data.

  \label{fig:Fig1_338} }
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

The temperature dependence of the theoretical LTC, induced by
$\tau_{\lambda\text{ph-ph}}$, is close to $T^{-1}$ because 300 K is high enough
to approximate the linewidth in Eq.~(\ref{eq:linewidth}) by a high-temperature
limit for these phases.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_338}-a, the temperature
dependence of the experimental data of a chemically vapor-deposited
$\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$ sample~\cite{hirai} is deviated from $T^{-1}$
considerably, intersecting the theoretical curves of the $\kappa$$_{xx}$ and
$\kappa$$_{zz}$ at 400 and 600 K, respectively.  Thus no value of $w$ adjusts
the theoretical LTC to the experimental curve.  The full solution of LBTE would
negligibly cure the disagreement.  Including the simple phonon lifetime of
boundary scattering, $\tau_{\lambda,\text{bs}}=L/|\mathbf{v}_\lambda|$, into
the total phonon lifetime according to Matthiessen's rule, could not explain
the discrepancy as well.  $\tau_{\lambda,\text{bs}}=L/|\mathbf{v}_\lambda|$
with $L$ = 0.75 $\mu\text{m}$, which was much smaller than the experimental
grain size 10 $\mu\text{m}$, decreases the room-temperature theoretical
$\kappa$$_{xx}$ and $\kappa$$_{zz}$ values toward the experimental value, but
severely underestimated the experimental values at the high temperature side.
At present, the reason for the discrepancy between the theoretical and
experimental behaviors is unclear.  Although the crystal structure of the
experimental sample was characterized as $\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$, significant
lattice defects might exist in the as-deposited sample as pointed out by
Hirosaki {\it et al.}~\cite{hirosaki-md}, and many of them might be diminished
in the high temperature side of the measurement.
The experimental values of the $\beta$ phase ceramic bulk~\cite{hirosaki} in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_338}-b fall well between the calculated values of
$\kappa$$_{xx}$ and  $\kappa$$_{zz}$.  The experimental data are nearly
parallel to the theoretical $\kappa$$_{xx}$ and  $\kappa$$_{zz}$ curves.  If we
compare the experimental values with $\sum_i \kappa_{ii}/3$, which is a simple
directional average, the calculation shows slight underestimations with respect
to the experiment, which can be understood from an experimentally tailored
microstructure containing large $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ grains selectively grown
along the $c$ axis.~\cite{hirosaki}

The theoretical curve adjusted with $w=0.37$ explains well the experimental
data of the poly-crystal bulk in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_338}-b.  For the effects of
lattice defects most of which are grain boundaries, we included
$\tau_{\lambda,\text{BS}}$ with $L = 1$ $\mu\text{m}$ to further fit the
theoretical curve ($w=0.44$) to the experimental data.  The $L$ value is
similar to the average grain size (2 $\mu\text{m}$) of the experimental
polycrystalline sample~\cite{hirosaki}. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_338}-b also contains the experimental $\kappa$$_{xx}$ and
$\kappa$$_{zz}$ at room temperature by filled squares, which are in-between the
theoretical components with and without $\tau_{\lambda,\text{BS}}$.
The LTC values with the equilibrium lattice volumes ($V_\text{eq}$) at 300,
600, 900, 1200 and 1500 K within QHA are plotted by crosses in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig1_338}.  The deviations due to the thermal expansions were
less than 1 \%. Therefore this effect is negligible for the present study.  The
degree of the differences is similar to the case of Si and Ge~\cite{ward-ltc}.

The cross-sections of the phonon frequency distributions on the $b^*$-$c^*$
planes in the first Brillouin-zones are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig3_338}. 
The cross-sections of other planes containing the $c^*$ axis did not differ
much from Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig3_338}; thus, we focus on the results for the
$b^*$-$c^*$ planes as representative of all such planes. We show only the
frequencies of four modes from the lowest frequency because they contribute
significantly to LTC.
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig3_338}-a shows that the frequency distributions and group
velocities of $\alpha$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are fairly isotropic. 
On the other hand, in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig3_338}-b of the $\beta$ phase, the
iso-frequency lines in $0.06 \le q_{c^*} \le 0.12$ (\AA$^{-1}$) are rather
parallel to the qb* axis, indicating that the four modes of the $\beta$ phase,
in a significantly large part of the Brillouin zone, have group velocities
oriented along the $c$ axis.

Figure \ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338} shows the phonon band diagrams of the three
Si$_3$N$_4$ phases. The entire band diagrams are almost identical to those reported
earlier~\cite{kuwabara,xu}. However, here we focus on the group velocities on
high-symmetry paths for the entire frequency range. This has not been
investigated by the previous works.
The acoustic branches in the $\alpha$ phase highlighted in red along the
$\Gamma$--A path in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}-a do not increase their frequencies much more
than those along the other paths, $\Gamma$--K or $\Gamma$--M. The frequency maxima along the
$\Gamma$--A path are around 7 THz, rather close to the maxima along the
$\Gamma$--K and $\Gamma$--M
paths (around 5 THz). The upper branches along the $\Gamma$--A path are also as flat
as the upper branches along the $\Gamma$--K and $\Gamma$--M paths.
In contrast, in the band diagram of the $\beta$ phase
(Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}-b), the acoustic phonon branches highlighted in
red along the $\Gamma$--A path increase their frequencies almost linearly from the
$\Gamma$-point to the A-point and reach around 10 THz, along which the group velocity
component vλ,z　FROM HERE!!!  maintains high values. This difference is because the
$\Gamma$--A path
length of the β phase is approximately half that of α. The lattice constant c
of α is nearly twice that of β, owing to the difference in the stacking manner
of the basal layers. Normally, optical branches are flat; however, the upper
branches along the Γ-A path also have significantly large vλ,z.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}-c for the γ phase, the acoustic phonon
branches highlighted in red show significant linear dispersion along the L-Γ-X
path. The frequencies of the longitudinal acoustic modes are 14 and 12.5 THz
at the L- and X-points. The frequencies of the transverse acoustic modes are
approximately half the values of the longitudinal modes at the L-point and a
factor of 1/√2 smaller than the longitudinal modes at the X-point, as in the
case of fcc rare gas solids~\cite{dove-p30}. The roughly constant gradients of
the branches are large, reflecting the large elastic constants of the γ phase
as shown in Table \ref{table:LTC-exp}.

In the band diagram of $\beta$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}-b), along
the $\Gamma$--A path, the acoustic phonon branches highlighted in red
increase their frequencies almost linearly from the $\Gamma$-point to
the zone boundary of the A-point around 10 THz. Their gradients are
large, so the group velocity components along the c axis maintain high
values. Normally, optical branches are flat; however, the upper branches
along the same path, highlighted in blue, also have significantly large
group velocity components along the c axis.

In contrast, the corresponding acoustic branches in the $\alpha$ phase
highlighted in red in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}-a do not increase
their frequencies as much as those of the $\beta$ phase. This is because
the $\Gamma$--A path length of the $\alpha$ phase is approximately half
that of $\beta$. The lattice constant c of $\alpha$ is nearly twice that
of $\beta$, owing to the difference in the stacking manner of the basal
layers. The frequency maxima along the $\Gamma$--A path are around 7 THz,
rather close to the maxima along the $\Gamma$--K and $\Gamma$--M paths
(around 5 THz). Moreover, the upper branches highlighted in blue are
relatively flat, like the upper branches along the $\Gamma$--K and
$\Gamma$--M paths.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}-c for the $\gamma$ phase, the acoustic phonon branches
highlighted in red show significant linear dispersion along the
L-$\Gamma$-X path. The frequencies of the longitudinal acoustic modes
are 14 and 12.5 THz at the L- and X-points. The frequencies of the
transverse acoustic modes are approximately half the values of the
longitudinal modes at the L-point and a factor of $1/\sqrt{2}$ smaller
than the longitudinal modes at the X-point, as in the case of fcc rare
gas solids~\cite{dove-p30}. The roughly constant gradients of the branches are large,
reflecting the large elastic constants of the $\gamma$ phase

  \label{fig:Fig5_338_rev} }
 \end{center}
\end{figure*}
To investigate the microscopic phonon-phonon interaction related to the thermal
transport, we analyze the linewidths in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-d.
The linewidths of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are similar to each other.
They increase with frequency monotonically, containing a terrace at 6--8 THz.
On the other hand, the linewidths of $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$, with a larger
scattering in their values, more steeply increases until $\sim$ 7 THz and then
stops increasing.
The behavior is much different from those in $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_4$N$_4$.
The marked difference is originated from the phase space available for three
phonon scattering processes, showed in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-e by the
weighted joint density of states $N_\lambda$,
% weighted jdos 

\begin{align}
 \label{eq:wjdos}
 &N_\lambda = \frac{1}{N}
  \sum_{\lambda' \lambda''}
  \Delta(-\mathbf{q}+\mathbf{q}'+\mathbf{q}'') \times \nonumber \\ 
 &\left\{ (n_{\lambda'} + n_{\lambda''}+1) 
   \delta(\omega_\lambda-\omega_{\lambda'}-\omega_{\lambda''}) \right.
   + \nonumber \\ 
 &\;\;(n_{\lambda'}-n_{\lambda''})
  \left[\delta(\omega_\lambda +\omega_{\lambda'}-\omega_{\lambda''})
 \right. 
 \left. -\left. \delta(\omega_\lambda - \omega_{\lambda'}+\omega_{\lambda''})
 \right]\right\}.
\end{align}
Because of the marked difference in linewidths for $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$, we
could not compare the effect of the group velocity on the thermal transport with
the other phases.

%Therefore in terms of the lattice thermal conductivities, no single microscopic
%phonon property in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev} characterizes
%$\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$. 


%The frequency dependences of the linewidths for all the Si$_3$N$_4$ phases can
%be explained in terms of the phase space available for three phonon scattering
%processes in the same frequency range. In Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-e we show
%the phase space by the weighted joint density of states $N_\lambda$, 
%
% weighted jdos 
%
%\begin{align}
% \label{eq:wjdos}
% &N_\lambda = \frac{1}{N}
%  \sum_{\lambda' \lambda''}
%  \Delta(-\mathbf{q}+\mathbf{q}'+\mathbf{q}'') \times \nonumber \\ 
% &\left\{ (n_{\lambda'} + n_{\lambda''}+1) 
%   \delta(\omega_\lambda-\omega_{\lambda'}-\omega_{\lambda''}) \right.
%   + \nonumber \\ 
% &\;\;(n_{\lambda'}-n_{\lambda''})
%  \left[\delta(\omega_\lambda +\omega_{\lambda'}-\omega_{\lambda''})
% \right. 
% \left. -\left. \delta(\omega_\lambda - \omega_{\lambda'}+\omega_{\lambda''})
% \right]\right\},
%\end{align}
Nevertheless the frequency dependences of the linewidths for all the polymorphs
can be explained in terms of the phase space. Similar plateaus as in the
linewidths are found  at 6--8 THz for $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and
above $\sim$ 7 THz for $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$. 
Additionally, the anharmonicity of the phonon modes in the same frequency-range
as the linewidths is shown by the average phonon-phonon interaction strength
$P_\lambda$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-f, 
% average phonon-phonon interaction strength
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:avepp}
 &P_\lambda = \frac{1}{(3n_a)^2}
  \sum_{\lambda' \lambda''}
  \bigl|\Phi_{-\lambda\lambda'\lambda''}\bigl|^2. 
\end{align}
The linewidths scatter more in the order of $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and
$\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$.
$P_\lambda$ values scatter more in the same order. 
We can see that the overall shape of frequency-dependence of the linewidths is
originated from the phase space represented by $N_\lambda$, while the scatter in
the linewidth values comes from the anharmonicity as measured by $P_\lambda$.
The approximated linewidths $\tilde{\Gamma}_\lambda$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-g, composed of the products of $N_\lambda$ and
$P_\lambda$, 
% tilde Gamma
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:tildegamma}
 &\tilde{\Gamma}_\lambda = \frac{18\pi}{\hbar^2}
 P_{\lambda}N_{\lambda},
\end{align}
may well show similar frequency-dependences to the linewidths as well. 
For quantitative comparison, the correlation coefficients between
($\Gamma_\lambda$, $N_\lambda$), ($\Gamma_\lambda$, $P_\lambda$), and
($\Gamma_\lambda$, $\tilde{\Gamma}_\lambda$) spaces are (0.97, 0.92, and 0.54 for
$\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$, respectively), (0.94, 0.84 and
0.73) and (0.96, 0.92 and 0.71), respectively (See SM for details).
 
Although the values for $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$ are much lower
than the other two polymorphs, the behavior of the linewidths in the present
systems are well characterized by $N_\lambda$ and $P_\lambda$. 

The  outlines of the frequency-dependence of linewidths are very similar between
$\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$.
Thus the phonon lifetimes make small differences in their thermal conductivities. 
We can ascribe the anisotropy in their thermal conductivities to the group
velocity components. In Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-c are shown the density of
states weighted by the square of group velocity components along $i$ = $x$ and
$z$, defined by 
% gv weighted dos
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:v2dos}
 \langle\text{v}^2_i(\omega)\rangle = \frac{1}{N_\mathbf{q}\Omega}
 \int_0^\omega \sum_\lambda
 \text{v}_{\lambda,i}^2\delta(\omega'-\omega)d\omega'.
\end{align}
The larger weights of squared group velocity components are distributed in low
frequencies, as compared with the ordinal DOS (Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-b).
The relative intensities of $\langle\text{v}^2_z\rangle$ and
$\langle\text{v}^2_x\rangle$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-c resemble the
corresponding intensities of $d\kappa^\text{c}_{zz}/d\omega$ and
$d\kappa^\text{c}_{xx}/d\omega$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-a. This is an
evidence for the relative degrees of the anisotropy in thermal transport of
$\alpha$- and $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ originating from the square of group velocity
components.

For $\gamma$-Si$_3$N$_4$, we can qualitatively deduce that mutual cancellation
between the larger $\Gamma_\lambda$ and $\langle\text{v}^2\rangle$ values
suppresses $\kappa^\text{c}$ to the value as small as $\kappa^\text{c}_{xx}$ of
$\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$.
%
%
%
%
%
%The distributions of the phonon lifetimes are shown in
%Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-a. The DOS and cumulative thermal
%conductivities are attached in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev}-b and c, to
%allow the distributions of the phonon states and their contributions to
%LTC to be examined with ease. The common trend is that the phonon
%lifetime decreases with increasing $\omega$ in the lower frequency
%region ($<6$ THz). Most of the phonon lifetimes of the $\alpha$ phase
%are larger than those of the $\beta$ phase in this frequency
%region. However, above 6 THz, the phonon lifetimes of the three phases
%are distributed similarly and roughly constant. The values for $\gamma$
%are as low as half those for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
%%
%\textcolor{red}{The vertical lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev} show
%the maximum frequencies of the Debye model, $\nu_\text{D}$. We use
%$\nu_\text{D}$ as a roughly estimated frequency-boundary between the
%acoustic and optical phonon modes. From Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig5_338_rev} and
%the band diagrams of Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338}, we can highlight the
%frequency-dependent microscopic mechanisms on 1) the large $\kappa_{zz}$
%of the $\beta$ phase, and 2) the relatively small LTC value of the
%$\gamma$ phase.}
%
%\textcolor{red}{Only the $zz$ component of
%$\boldsymbol{\kappa}^\text{c}(\omega)$ for the $\beta$ phase increases
%much as  increases beyond $\nu_\text{D}$. It is a characteristic point
%of the $\beta$ phase that the phonon modes of $\omega > \nu_\text{D}$
%largely contribute to the $\kappa_{zz}$. They contribute approximately
%1/3 of the total $\kappa_{zz}$. Because the phonon lifetimes in this
%frequency range are not large, a large number of phonon modes with large
%z components of group velocities, including optical phonon modes like
%the upper branches highlighted by blue in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig4_ver5_338},
%contribute to the $\kappa_{zz}$. In contrast to the $\beta$ phase, the
%$zz$ component of the $\alpha$ phase does not increase much above
%$\nu_\text{D}$, as all the phonon branches reach to the Brillouin zone
%boundary and decreased their group velocities.}
%
%\textcolor{red}{The $\gamma$ phase has the largest $\nu_\text{D}$, and
%the smallest phonon lifetimes above 6 THz. Thus the
%frequency-distributions of the acoustic phonon states and their
%lifetimes of the $\gamma$ phase are least compatible for high LTC among
%the three phases, while the optical phonon modes do not have large group
%velocities. This is the reason for the relatively small LTC of the
%$\gamma$ phase in spite of the large group velocities of the acoustic
%branches.}

%Our argument that the anisotropic group velocities are responsible for
%the anisotropic LTC of the $\beta$ phase can be simply confirmed by
%hypothetically setting the two ($C_\lambda$ and $\tau_\lambda$) of the
%microscopic four terms ($C_\lambda$, $v_\lambda$, $\tau_\lambda$, and

%approximation for $\omega < 19$ THz, and we set $\tau$ to 20 ps and let
%the of the $\beta$ phase approach at $\omega=12$ THz for simplicity.

%\textcolor{red}{$\boldsymbol{\kappa}^{\text{c}'}(\omega)$ shows as large
%anisotropy as $\boldsymbol{\kappa}^{\text{c}}(\omega)$, confirming that the anisotropy in LTC is caused by the
